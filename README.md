## Features

PizzaSlices lets you create custom rings, fill them with various types of actions and bind them to different keys. It doesn't reuse any of your existing action buttons so you won't lose any of that precious action bar space.

### Raid Marks

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pizzahawaiii/media/refs/heads/main/PizzaSlices/raidmarks.gif" width="50%" align="left" />

Assign any raid marks quickly and easily with the press of a single button, no matter if you're using [SoloRaidTargetIcons](https://github.com/refaim/SoloRaidTargetIcons) or in a group/raid. There's also a special action to instantly clear all previously assigned raid marks.

### Abilities

You can add all your active abilities to rings. Buffs, auras, hunter aspects, or even damage and healing abilities if you really want to - go crazy!

### Mounts

All your mounts can be added to rings as well, anything you see in the 'Mounts' tab in your spellbook.

### Toys & Companions

Anything from the 'Toys' and 'Companions' tabs in your spellbook can also be added to rings.

### Professions & General

Your professions and anything else listed in the 'General' tab of your spellbook are available as well. Excluding passive abilities, obviously.

### Macros

You can also add macros to rings if you need even more flexibility.

### ItemRack Sets

If you're using ItemRack, you can also add your gear sets to rings to quickly change outfits on the fly.

## Opening Rings via Macros

You can open your PizzaSlices rings through macros instead of game-internal key bindings with this command:

```
/ps open <ringIndex>
```

`<ringIndex>` has to be a number - the index of the ring you want to open according to the ring list in the settings menu, starting with `1`.

Let's say you see three rings in the settings:

```
Raid Marks
General
Mounts
```

Then creating a macro with `/ps open 1` would open the Raid Marks, `/ps open 2` would open the General ring, and `/ps open 3` would open the Mounts ring.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Opening rings through macros is currently not supported if you have the addon Bongos installed.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This feature requires your action buttons to trigger on keydown, not on keyup (which is the game's default). PizzaSlices therefore comes with its own version of [Snowfall](https://github.com/Linae-Kronos/Classic-Snowfall). Note that if you're using pfUI, PizzaSlices forces your "Trigger Actions on Key Down" pfUI action bar setting to always be enabled.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Opening rings via macros doesn't work when clicking the macro button. You have to bind the macro action button to a key and press that key to open the ring.

## Settings

Use one of the following commands to open the settings menu:

```
/ps
/slices
/pizzaslices
```

### Add Stuff to a Ring

On the 'Rings' tab, click on the green + or on the name of one of the existing rings. Select one of the categories on the right. Then, drag & drop any of the items from the center into the ring area on the left (purple background). Finally, click 'Save'.

### Remove Stuff from a Ring
